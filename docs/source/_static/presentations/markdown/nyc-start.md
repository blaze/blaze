## TL;DR

Blaze is an extensible interface for data analytics.

It feels like NumPy/Pandas.  It drives other data systems.

Blaze expressions enable high-level reasoning.



## Motivation

NumPy and Pandas serve as the foundation for the PyData stack

... but they are limited to memory

*The state of biggish-data analysis is still wild*


## Approach

*   Blaze is a user interface
    *   ... and something like a compiler
    *   ... for analytic processing (like Pandas, not like Redis)
*   It isn't a database or a Pandas replacement
*   It complements pre-existing systems by improving user access


## Play time

*In which we pray to the demo gods*

<hr>

* Main points: Blaze ...
    *  has a familiar interface
    *  directs other mature projects to do your analysis
    *  extends beyond Python/Pandas
    *  Supports Pandas-like and NumPy-like computation

Also, in case you missed it

    conda install -c blaze blaze
