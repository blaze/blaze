Layouts

Scalar layouts are arangements of scalar matrix data on to blocks
of memory that may or may not be contigious.

- Chunked
- Multichunks
- Continuous
- Strided

If we build a composite block structure as some union of two
multiple blocks of data, then we need only have a invertible linear
transformation which is able to map coordinates between the local
coordinates of the chunks as we pull bytes from them.
