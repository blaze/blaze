=========
Extending
=========

Learning from our experience with SciPy we aim to make Blaze modular
from the beginning and allow experts with different backgrounds to enter
the project at different levels of the stack.

Those that wish to add domain knowledge to Blaze can extend types and
functions. While those who are interested in execution can extend with
the execution backends to different hardware and code generation paths.
