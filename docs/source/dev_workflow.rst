==================
Developer Workflow 
==================

Blaze is being developed as an open source project by
`Continuum Analytics`_. This page describes the basic workflow
that development follows, and may be used as a guide for how
to contribute to the project.

Source code and issue management are hosted in `this github page`_,
and usage of git roughly follows `GitHub Flow`_. What this means
is that the `master` branch is generally expected to be stable,
with tests passing on all platforms, and features are developed in
descriptively named feature branches and merged via github's
Pull Requests.
