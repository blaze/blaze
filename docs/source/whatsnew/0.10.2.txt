Release 0.10.2
-----------------

:Release: 0.10.2

New Expressions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

None

Improved Expressions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Adds support for ``any`` and ``all`` to the sql backend (:issue:`1511`).

New Backends
^^^^^^^^^^^^

None

Improved Backends
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* To allow access to the ``map`` and ``apply`` expressions in client / server
  interactions when in a trusted environment, new ``_trusted`` versions of the
  several default ``SerializationFormat`` instances were added.  These trusted
  variants allow (de)serialization of builtin functions, NumPy functions, and
  Pandas functions.  They are intentially kept separate from the default
  versions to ensure they are not accidentally enabled in untrusted
  environments (:issue:`1497` :issue:`1504`).

Experimental Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

None

API Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^

None

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* Fixed a bug with ``to_tree()`` and ``slice`` objects. Have to change the
  order of cases in ``to_tree()`` to ensure ``slice`` objects are handled
  before lookups inside the ``names`` namespace (:issue:`1516`).
* Perform more input validation for ``sort()`` expression arguments
  (:issue:`1517`).
* Fixes issue with string and datetime coercions on Pandas objects
  (:issue:`1519` :issue:`1524`).
* Fixed a bug with ``isin`` and ``Selection``\s on sql selectables
  (:issue:`1528`).

Miscellaneous
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Expression Identity Rework
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Expression are now memoized by their inputs. This means that two identical
expressions will always be the same object, or that ``a.isidentical(b)`` is the
same as ``a is b``. ``isidentical`` is called hundreds of thousands of times in
a normal blaze workload. Moving more work to expression construction time has
been shown to dramatically improve compute times when the expressions grow in
complexity or size. In the past, blaze was spending linear time relative to the
expression size to compare expressions because it needed to recurse through the
entire expression tree but now it can do ``isidentical`` in constant time.

Users should still use ``a.isidentical(b)`` instead of ``a is b`` because we
reserve the right to add more arguments or change the implementation of
``isidentical`` in the future.
