Release 0.10.0
--------------

:Release: 0.10.0
:Date: TBD

New Expressions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The ``sample`` expression allows random sampling of rows to facilitate
  interactive data exploration (:issue:`1410`).  It is implemented for the
  Pandas, Dask, SQL, and Python backends.
* Adds :func:`~blaze.expr.expressions.coalesce` expression which takes two
  arguments and returns the first non missing value. If both are missing then
  the result is missing. For example: ``coalesce(1, 2) == 1``,
  ``coalesce(None, 1)`` == 1, and ``coalesce(None, None) == None``.
  This is inspired by the sql function of the same name (:issue:`1409`).
* Adds :func:`~blaze.expr.expressions.cast` expression to reinterpret an
  expression's dshape. This is based on C++ ``reinterpret_cast``, or just normal
  C casts. For example:
  ``symbol('s', 'int32').cast('uint32').dshape == dshape('uint32')``. This
  expression has no affect on the computation, it merely tells blaze to treat
  the result of the expression as the new dshape. The compute definition for
  ``cast`` is simply:

  .. code-block:: python

     @dispatch(Cast, object)
     def compute_up(expr, data, **kwargs):
         return data

  (:issue:`1409`).

Improved Expressions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The test suite was expanded to validate proper expression input error handling
  (:issue:`1420`).
* The :func:`~blaze.expr.datetime.truncate` function was refactored to raise an
  exception for incorrect inputs, rather than using assertions (:issue:`1443`).
* The docstring for :class:`~blaze.expr.collections.Merge` was expanded to
  include examples using :class:`~blaze.expr.expressions.Label` to control the
  ordering of the columns in the result (:issue:`1447`).

New Backends
^^^^^^^^^^^^

None

Improved Backends
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Adds :class:`~blaze.expr.math.greatest` and :class:`~blaze.expr.math.least`
  support to the sql backend (:issue:`1428`).
* Generalize ``Field`` to support :class:`collections.Mapping` object
  (:issue:`1467`).

Experimental Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The :class:`~blaze.expr.strings.str_upper` and
  :class:`~blaze.expr.strings.str_lower` expressions were added for the Pandas
  and SQL backends (:issue:`1462`).  These are marked experimental since their
  names are subject to change.  More string methods will be added in coming
  versions.

API Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^

* The :class:`~blaze.expr.strings.strlen` expression was deprecated in favor of
  :class:`~blaze.expr.strings.str_len` (:issue:`1462`).
* Long deprecated :func:`~blaze.table.Table` and
  :func:`~blaze.table.TableSymbol` were removed (:issue:`1441`).  The
  ``TableSymbol`` tests in ``test_table.py`` were migrated to
  ``test_symbol.py``.
* :func:`~blaze.interactive.Data` has been deprecated in favor of
  :func:`~blaze.interactive.data`.  :class:`~blaze.interactive.InteractiveSymbol`
  has been deprecated and temporarily replaced by
  :class:`~blaze.interactive._Data`.  These deprecations will be in place for
  the 0.10 release.  In the 0.11 release, :class:`~blaze.interactive._Data`
  will be renamed to ``Data``, calls to :func:`~blaze.interactive.data` will
  create ``Data`` instances, and :class:`~blaze.interactive.InteractiveSymbol`
  will be removed (:issue:`1431` and :issue:`1421`).
* :func:`~blaze.compute.core.compute` has a new keyword argument
  ``return_type`` which defaults to ``'native'`` (:issue:`1401`, :issue:`1411`,
  :issue:`1417`), which preserves existing behavior.  In the 0.11 release,
  ``return_type`` will be changed to default to ``'core'``, which will
  ``odo`` non-core backends into core backends as the final step in a call to
  ``compute``.
* Due to API instability and on the recommendation of DyND developers, we
  removed the DyND dependency temporarily (:issue:`1379`).  When DyND achieves
  its 1.0 release, DyND will be re-incorporated into Blaze.  The existing DyND
  support in Blaze was rudimentary and based on an egregiously outdated and
  buggy version of DyND.  We are aware of no actual use of DyND via Blaze in
  practice.
* The :class:`~blaze.expr.expressions.Expr` ``__repr__`` method's triggering of
  implicit computation has been deprecated.  Using this aspect of Blaze will
  trigger a ``DeprecationWarning`` in version 0.10, and this behavior will be
  replaced by a standard (boring) ``__repr__`` implementation in version 0.11.
  Users can explicitly trigger a computation to see a quick view of the results
  of an interactive expression by means of the
  :func:`~blaze.expr.expressions.Expr.peek` method.  By setting the
  :mod:`~blaze.interactive.use_new_repr` flag to ``True``, users can use the
  new (boring) ``__repr__`` implementation in version 0.10 (:issue:`1414`
  and :issue:`1395`).


Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* The :class:`~blaze.expr.strings.str_upper` and
  :class:`~blaze.expr.strings.str_lower` schemas were fixed to pass through
  their underlying ``_child``'s schema to ensure option types are handled
  correctly (:issue:`1472`).
* Fixed a bug with Pandas' implementation of ``compute_up`` on
  :class:`~blaze.expr.broadcast.Broadcast` expressions (:issue:`1442`).  Added
  tests for Pandas frame and series and dask dataframes on ``Broadcast``
  expressions.
* Fixed a bug with :class:`~blaze.expr.collections.Sample` on SQL backends
  (:issue:`1452` :issue:`1423` :issue:`1424` :issue:`1425`).
* Fixed several bugs relating to adding new datasets to blaze server instances
  (:issue:`1459`).  Blaze server will make a best effort to ensure that the
  added dataset is valid and loadable; if not, it will return appropriate HTTP
  status codes.


Miscellaneous
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Adds logging to server compute endpoint.  Includes expression being computed
  and total time to compute. (:issue:`1436`)
* Merged the ``core`` and ``all`` conda recipes (:issue:`1451`).  This
  simplifies the build process and makes it consistent with the single
  ``blaze`` package provided by the Anaconda distribution.
* Adds a ``--yaml-dir`` option to ``blaze-server`` to indicate the server
  should load path-based ``yaml`` resources relative to the yaml file's
  directory, not the CWD of the process (:issue:`1460`).
