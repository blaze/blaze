Release |version|
-----------------

:Release: |version|
:Date: TBD

New Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Adds :class:`~blaze.expr.collections.Tail` which acts as an opposite to
  head. This is exposed throught the `~blaze.expr.collections.tail` function.
  This returns the last ``n`` elements from a collection. (:issue:`1187`)

Improved Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* :class:`~blaze.expr.collections.Distinct` expressions now support an `on`
  parameter to allow distinct on a subset of columns (:issue:`1159`)
* :class:`~blaze.expr.reductions.Reduction` instances are now named as their
  class name if their ``_child`` attribute is named ``'_'`` (:issue:`1198`)

New Backends
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Improved Backends
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Blaze now tries a bit harder to avoid generating ``ScalarSelects`` when using
  the SQL backend (:issue:`1201`, :issue:`1205`)

API Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

* Serialization format in blaze server is now passed in as a mimetype
  (:issue:`1176`)
* We only allow and use HTTP ``POST`` requests when sending a computation to
  Blaze server for consistency with the HTTP spec (:issue:`1172`)
* Allow :class:`~blaze.server.client.Client` objects to explicitly disable
  verification of ssl certificates by passing ``verify_ssl=False``.
  (:issue:`1170`)
* Enable basic auth for the blaze server. The server now accepts an
  ``authorization`` keyword which must be a callable that accepts an
  object holding the username and password, or None if no auth was given and
  returns a bool indicating if the request should be allowed.
  :class:`~blaze.server.client.Client` objects can pass an optional
  ``auth`` keyword which should be a tuple of (username, password) to
  send to the server. (:issue:`1175`)

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* Upgrade versioneer so that our version string is now :pep:`440` compliant
  (:issue:`1171`)
* Computed columns (e.g., the result of a call to
  :func:`~blaze.expr.collections.transform`) can now be accessed via standard
  attribute access when using the SQL backend (:issue:`1201`)
* Fixed a bug where blaze server was depending on an implementation detail of
  CPython regarding ``builtins`` (:issue:`1196`)
* Fixed incorrect SQL generated by count on a subquery (:issue:`1202`).
