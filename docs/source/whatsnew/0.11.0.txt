* Adds support for ``any`` and ``all`` to the sql backend (:issue:`1511`).

New Backends

None

Improved Backends
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* To allow access to the ``map`` and ``apply`` expressions in client / server
  interactions when in a trusted environment, new ``_trusted`` versions of the
  several default ``SerializationFormat`` instances were added.  These trusted
  variants allow (de)serialization of builtin functions, NumPy functions, and
  Pandas functions.  They are intentially kept separate from the default
  versions to ensure they are not accidentally enabled in untrusted
  environments (:issue:`1497` :issue:`1504`).
