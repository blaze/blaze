API Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

* Removed support for Python 2.6 (:issue:`1267`).
* Removed support for Python 3.3 (:issue:`1270`).

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* Fixed a bug where ``Merge`` expressions would unpack option types in their
  fields. This could cause you to have a table where ``expr::{a: int32}`` but
  ``expr.a::?int32``. Note that the dotted acces is an option (:issue:`1262`).
* Fixed a bug that prevented creating a
  :class:`~blaze.interactive.InteractiveSymbol` that wrapped ``nan`` if the
  dshape was ``datetime``. This now correctly coerces to `NaT` (:issue:`1272`).
* Fixed an issue where blaze client/server could not use `isin` expressions
  because the ``frozenset`` failed to serialize. This also added support for
  rich serialization over json for things like datetimes (:issue:`1255`).
* Fixed a bug where ``len`` would fail on an interactive expression whose
  resources were sqlalchemy objects (:issue:`1273`).
