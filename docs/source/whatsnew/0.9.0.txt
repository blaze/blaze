API Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

* Removed support for Python 2.6 (:issue:`1267`).
* Removed support for Python 3.3 (:issue:`1270`).

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* Fixed a bug where ``Merge`` expressions would unpack option types in their
  fields. This could cause you to have a table where ``expr::{a: int32}`` but
  ``expr.a::?int32``. Note that the dotted acces is an option (:issue:`1262`).
