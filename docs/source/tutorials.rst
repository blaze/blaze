This chapter goes through a series of tutorials that exercises different aspects of Blaze on a friendly and step-by-step way.  These are great if you are learning Blaze, or you want better insight on how to do specific things with it.

Creating arrays
===============

Building basic arrays
---------------------

Let's start creating a small array:

  >>> import blaze
  >>> a = blaze.array([2, 3, 4])
  >>> print a
  [2 3 4]

Easy uh?  Blaze tries to follow the NumPy API as much as possible, so
that people will find it easy to start doing basic things.

Now, let's have a look at the representation of the `a` array::

  >>> a
  array([2, 3, 4],
        dshape='3, int64')

You are seeing here at a first difference with NumPy, and it is the
`dshape` attribute, which is basically the fusion of `shape` and
`dtype` concepts for NumPy.  Such unification of concepts will be
handy for performing advanced operations (like views) in a more
powerful way.

Note that when creating from a Python iterable, a datashape will be
inferred::

  >>> print(a.dshape)
  3, int64

In this example, the shape part is '3' while the type part is 'int64'.

Let's create an array of floats::

  >>> b = blaze.array([1.2, 3.5, 5.1])
  >>> print(b)
  [ 1.2  3.5  5.1]
  >>> print(b.dshape)
  3, float64

And a bidimensional array::

  >>> c = blaze.array([ [1, 2], [3, 4] ]) 
  >>> print(c)
  [[1 2]
   [3 4]]
  >>> print(c.dshape)
  2, 2, int64

or as many dimensions as you like::

  >>> d = blaze.array([ [ [1, 2], [3, 4] ], [ [5, 6], [7, 8] ] ])
  >>> print(d)
  [[[1 2]
    [3 4]]

   [[5 6]
    [7 8]]]
  >>> print(d.dshape)
  2, 2, 2, int64

You can even build a compressed array in-memory::

  >>> blz = blaze.array([1,2,3], caps={'compress': True})
  >>> print(blz)
  [1 2 3]

It is possible to force a type in a given array. This allows a broader
selection of types on construction::

  >>> e = blaze.array([ 1, 2, 3], dshape='3, float32') 
  >>> e
  array([ 1.,  2.,  3.],
        dshape='3, float32')

Note that the dimensions in the datashape when creating from a
collection can be omitted. If that's the case, the dimensions will be
inferred. The following is thus equivalent::

  >>> f = blaze.array([ 1, 2, 3], dshape='float32')
  >>> f
  array([ 1.,  2.,  3.],
        dshape='3, float32')

Blaze also supports arrays to be made persistent. This can be achieved
by adding the storage keyword parameter to an array constructor::

  >>> g = blaze.array([ 1, 2, 3], dshape='float32', storage=blaze.Storage('myarray'))
  >>> g
  array([ 1.,  2.,  3.],
        dshape='3, float32')

You can use the persistent array as if it was an in-memory
array. However, it is persistent and it will survive your python
session. Later you can gain a reference to the array, even from a
different python session by name, using the `open` function::

  >>> f = blaze.open(blaze.Storage('myarray'))
  >>> f
  array([ 1.,  2.,  3.],
        dshape='3, float32')

A persistent array is backed on non-volatile storage (currently, only
a filesystem is supported, but the list of supported storages may
increase in the future). That means that there are system resources
allocated to store that array, even when you exit your python
session. If you are done with the persistent array and want to free
its resources, you can just 'drop' it::

  >>> f = blaze.drop(blaze.Storage('myarray'))

After dropping a persistent array this way, any 'open' version you may
had of it will no longer be valid. You won't be able to reopen it
either. It is effectively deleted.


Evaluation
==========

Performing basic computations
-----------------------------

Performing computations in blaze is a 2 step process. First, you just
use expressions to build a *deferred* array. A *deferred* array,
instead of holding the result, knows how to build that result::

  >>> import blaze
  >>> a = blaze.array([ 1, 2, 3])
  >>> a.deferred
  False

::

  >>> b = blaze.array([ 4, 5, 6])
  >>> b.deferred
  False

::

  >>> r = a+b
  >>> r.deferred
  True

In order to obtain the results, just call the eval function with the
*deferred* array::

  >>> result = blaze.eval(r)
  >>> result
  array([5, 7, 9],
        dshape='3, int64')

So, why this extra step? why the need to evaluate instead of just
generating the result directly from a+b? The answer is a bit
complex. Making a long story short, using the *deferred* array allows
building a complex expression and optimize it as a whole before
execution. This allows removing the need of arrays for intermediate
results, as well as the need to perform several passes on data. A
short answer is that it allows blaze to perform better with big data sets.

Also, having an explicit evaluation method gives us a chance to
specify a few parameters telling how the resulting array should be
built. As can be seen in the array creation tutorial, an array can be
made in-memory, compressed in-memory or it can even be backed on the
file-system. We can eval directly to a persistent array::

  >>> result = blaze.eval(r, storage=blaze.Storage('res'))

In this sample we have used two small in-memory arrays to illustrate
execution. The same code can work for large arrays that are 'opened'
instead of being created/read, allowing the easy evaluation of
expression that is effectively out-of-core::

  >>> ba1 = blaze.open(blaze.Storage('big_array1'))
  >>> ba2 = blaze.open(blaze.Storage('big_array2'))
  >>> res = blaze.eval(ba1+ba2, storage=blaze.Storage('big_result'))

So it is possible to build complex array expressions that can be
executed without building huge intermediate arrays. It is also
possible to use persistent arrays or in-memory arrays as your operands
(or a mix of both, as they are all Blaze arrays). You are also able to
specify what kind of array you want for your result.
