:OP:

    Operator a mapping between multiple operands returning a
    single result.

:FUN:

    A function mapping multiple operands to results or effects.

:VAL:

    A value providing a byte interface.

Instances
~~~~~~~~~

The core graph node types in Blaze are:

* App
* ArrayNode
* ExpressionNode
* FloatNode
* Fun
* FunApp
* IndexNode
* IntNode
* Literal
* Op
* Slice
* StringNode

The domain and codomain of an operator are determined only in the
context of an application binding.

The domain and codomain of an function are fixed by definition.
