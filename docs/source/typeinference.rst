Type Inference
==============

Type Variables
--------------

Type variables are free paramaters standing for type or ranges of types.
A concrete type is fixed type in the base type system.

The goal of inference is to resolve the relationships between type
variables and concrete variables within the context of a of an
expression but without the need for explicit annotation.

Signatures
----------

The signature::

    (a, b) -> c

stands for a function of two arguments, the first of type ``a``, the second
of type ``b`` and returning type ``c``.

Would be this in Python 3 signature notation::

    def (x : a, y : b) -> c:
        pass

Type System
-----------

A type system in Blaze is collection of three functions::

    unifier :: (ty, ty) -> ty
    typeof :: value -> ty

And a collection of type objects with two special types::

    (?)   - dynamic type
    (top) - top type

This is specified by a namedtuple of the form::

    typesystem = namedtuple('TypeSystem', 'unifier, top, dynamic, typeof')

The type system over Blaze expression expressions is referred to
as ``BlazeT``.

Dynamic
-------

A dynamic type written as ( ``?`` ). It allows explicit down casting and
upcasting from any type to any type. In Blaze we use this to represent
opaque types that afford no specialization.

Rigid & Free
------------

Rigid type variables are those that appear in multiple times in the
signature::

     f : (a -> b -> a) -> c

     Rigid : [a]
     Free  : [b,c]

Context
-------

A context records the lexically-bound variables during the progression
of the type inference algorithm. It is a stateful dict passed through
the unifiers.
