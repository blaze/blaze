Blaze Documentation
===================

The blaze documentation is split over two repositories:

    The user and developer documentation:

         https://github.com/blaze/blaze/tree/master/docs (the 'docs' directory)

    The webpage, blaze.pydata.org:

        https://github.com/blaze/blaze/tree/gh-pages

User and Developer Documentation
================================
The documentation is under the 'docs' directory of the blaze repo (this directory).

To build the documentation, you need the basicstrap theme and sphinxjp.themecore:

    $ pip install sphinxjp.themes.basicstrap
    $ pip install numpydoc

You can edit the source files under docs/source/, after which you can build and
check the documentation:

    $ make html
    $ open build/html/index.html

This documentation can be uploaded to http://blaze.pydata.org/en/latest/index.html
using the gh-pages.py script under docs/:

    $ python gh-pages.py

then verify the repository under the 'gh-pages' directory and use 'git push'.

Webpage
=======
The blaze webpage on blaze.pydata.org can be fetched from here: https://github.com/blaze/blaze/tree/gh-pages
The documentation is linked to in the 'dev' subdirectory.
