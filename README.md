Blaze
=====

Blaze is the next-generation of NumPy. It is designed as a foundational
set of abstractions on which to build out-of-core and distributed
algorithms over a wide variety of data sources.

Blaze is a work in progress at the moment. The code is quite a distance
from feature complete. The code is released in an effort to start a
public discussion with our end users and community.

Blaze is approaching being a usable library, but does not have runnable
components at the moment.

Installing
----------

If you are interested in the development version of Blaze you can
obtain the source from Github.

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:ContinuumIO/blaze.git
```

Many of the dependencies ( llvm, numba, ... ) are non-trivial to
install. It is highly recommend that you build Blaze using the Anaconda
Python distribution.

Free Anaconda CE is available here: http://continuum.io/anacondace.html .
