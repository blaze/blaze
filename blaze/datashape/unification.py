"""
This module implements unification of datashapes. Unification is a general
problem that solves a system of equations between terms. In our case, the
terms are types (datashapes).

A difference with conventional unification is that our equations are not
necessarily looking for equality, they must account for coercions and
broadcasting.

A normalization phase accounts for broadcasting missing leading dimensions
by padding the types with one-sized dimensions. Coercion is resolved through
coercion constraints which act like subset relations. A unifier is
accompanied by a set of constraints but must hold for the free variables in
that type.
